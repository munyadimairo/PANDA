# [PANDA](https://panda.shef.ac.uk/) repository

This repository contains **Stata**, **SAS**, and **R** code and related material used for educational purposes as part of the [PANDA platform](https://panda.shef.ac.uk/). It gives opportunities for PANDA platform users to translate theory on adaptive designs into practice. Content of this repository is linked to [PANDA platform](https://panda.shef.ac.uk/) material.

## Illustration of the design of a multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) ([STOP OHSS](https://panda.shef.ac.uk/techniques/multi-arm-multi-stage-mams/categories/30#search_subheading_reference_42)) trial

**Stata** code (_stopohss_mams_code.do_) was used for the design of [STOP OHSS](https://panda.shef.ac.uk/techniques/multi-arm-multi-stage-mams/categories/30#search_subheading_reference_42) trial to illustrate:

- design specification,
- sample size calculation and operating characteristics.

## Illustration of the analysis of the MAMS [STOP OHSS](https://panda.shef.ac.uk/techniques/multi-arm-multi-stage-mams/categories/30#search_subheading_reference_42) trial with a binary outcome

Simulation based approach using **SAS** code to explore the:

- operating characteristics of the design (similar to above),
- properties of naive and bias-adjusted estimators (bias and confidence interval coverage).

A detailed sumamry report is provided. We are extremely grateful to **John Whitehead** for his generous contribution to the SAS code and related report.
