This repository contains R and Stata code used for educational purposes as part of the [PANDA](https://panda.shef.ac.uk/) platform. It gives opportunities for PANDA platform users to translate theory on adaptive designs into practice. The code in this repository is linked to context in PANDA. For example, _stopohss_mams_code.do_
