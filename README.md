# [PANDA](https://panda.shef.ac.uk/) repository

This repository contains R and Stata code used for educational purposes as part of the [PANDA platform](https://panda.shef.ac.uk/). It gives opportunities for PANDA platform users to translate theory on adaptive designs into practice. The code in this repository is linked to content in [PANDA platform](https://panda.shef.ac.uk/).

## Illustration of the design of a multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) ([STOP OHSS](https://panda.shef.ac.uk/techniques/multi-arm-multi-stage-mams/categories/30#search_subheading_reference_42)) trial

**Stata** code (_stopohss_mams_code.do_) was used for the design of [STOP OHSS trial](https://panda.shef.ac.uk/techniques/multi-arm-multi-stage-mams/categories/30#search_subheading_reference_42)to illustrate:

- design specification,
- sample size calculation and operating characteristics.

## Illustration of the analysis of the [STOP OHSS trial](https://panda.shef.ac.uk/techniques/multi-arm-multi-stage-mams/categories/30#search_subheading_reference_42) MAMS trial with a binary primary outcome

Simulation based approach using **SAS** code to explore the:

- operating characteristics of the design (similar to above),
- properties of naive and bias-adjusted estimators (bias and confidence interval coverage).

A detailed sumamry report is provided. We are extremely grateful to **John Whitehead** for his generous contribution to the SAS code and related report.
